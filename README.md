Sorry for not having much documentation. This uses a jquery slide framework. You can see my demo slides in index.html and add some more. It's fairly easy to embed HTML content in the slides, for example I've embedded, resized, and positioned a Flickr slideshow object.

A google maps slide is definitely something I want to look into.

Things are currently positioned 1/2 in the stylesheet (located in /css/style.css) and 1/2 inline... which is okay for now, I'll probably clean this up later.
